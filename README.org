* avk-emacs themes

Contrary to popular approach of carefully selecting colors based on some idea,
the  provided themes  were  made by  a  few years  of  trying different  color
combinations, out of random, just to fit my personal preference.

So far this  worked well, at least for  me, and my own sense  of color. Themes
provide 3  basic setups: 2  variations of dark  background, and one  for light
(suitable for sunny days).

I expect to improve those along the time, so please don't hesisteate to notify
me if you see any problem colors or missing package colors defined.
